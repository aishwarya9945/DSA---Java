# Algorithm: Find Largest Element in an Array
- Initialize a variable largest with the first element of the array.
- Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
- Compare each element with largest:
- If the current element is greater, update largest.
- After the loop ends, largest holds the maximum value.
- Return or print the result.
